## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

For the purposes of this demonstration, we have included the .env file in the repository to simplify the setup process for the jury. We acknowledge this is a security risk and not a best practice for production environments. Sensitive configurations, such as API keys or credentials, should never be stored directly in the repository.
